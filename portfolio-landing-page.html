        <h2>About me:</h2>
        <p>Hey everyone! My name is Carly Kozal & I have been living in the beautiful city of Portland, OR for the past three years. I hail from Philadelphia, PA and received my undergraduate degree in business administration from Temple University. Go Owls! I most enjoy hiking the PNW with soon to be husband, Bryan, & our pup, Daisy. I also love exploring the fantastic breweries our city has to offer & live music when I can get to a show. 
        <p>Aside from my attempts at web design on AOL in the late '90's, I do not have any coding or programming experience. For the past five years, I have worked in the insurance industry, specifically auto claims. After dying for some forum in which I could be creative or innovative, I started researching careers in computer science and was led to Epicodus. I hope Epicodus will be my first stepping stone in lifelong career in tech.</p>
